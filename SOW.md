# Project Title
## Travia Crack

### Team:
#### WIFI Warriors
#### JT Higgins, Ryan James, Adyn Cox

### Project Objective
#### Briefly describe the goal of the project. What problem are you trying to solve or what functionality are you aiming to achieve?

We are looking to make a game similar to trivia crack, where multiple users will be able to connect to a server. Once connected, the server will query the user to enter in information such as usernames, and then will prompt the user with questions that the client must answer. Most likely will be point based game. 

Multiple clients with one server. Secure back and forth communication between server and clients, allowing the clients to interact with each other.

### Scope:
#### Inclusions:
- One server
- Multiple clients (~4)
- Point based game, so there will be a winner
- Terminal based?
- Multiple categories of questions, or a randomized lists. All with a list of possible answers
- Query the users one at a time?
- Give the user a time frame to answer the question?
- Maybe have a maximum point total or a set amount of questions for everybody to determine when the game is done.
- Ability to terminate connection with the server if the user would like to quit.

#### Exclusions:
- List any tasks, features, or components that will not be included in the project.
- No GUI for simplicity purposes?

### Deliverables
- List the expected outputs or deliverables from the project, such as a working Python script, documentation, or presentations.
**Sprint 1:**
- Basic server setup - allow server to listen for connections
- Client side connection - allow the client to connect with the server
- Simple message exchange - Show that the server and client are able to talk back and forth successfully
- Error handling - Throw errors to the client or server based on if there is a failed connection, or if connection is lost.
- Testing - Test that the components work together successfully

### Timeline
#### Key Milestones:
- Outline the major milestones or checkpoints throughout the project, with estimated completion dates.
**Sprint 1 - OCT 6**
We want to have the clients and server in a healthy state where they can exchange messages and test that the functionality is working. If not let the client or server know of what the issues are. 

**Sprint 2**

**Sprint 3**

**Sprint 4**

**Sprint 5**

#### Tesk Breakdown:
- Create a detailed breakdown of tasks, assigning estimated hours or days to each.

### Technical Requirements
#### Hardware:
- Specify any hardware requirements, such as servers, networking equipment, or specific devices.
- **Have the server be a PC, Laptop, or something like a Pi**
- Clients would connect via laptop or PC.

#### Software:
- List the necessary software tools, programming languages (Python), libraries (socket, threading, etc.), and operating systems.
- Python
- Time library - MAYBE
- Random library - MAYBE
- Socket library
- Github - version control
- Python environment
- Possibly threading?

### Assumptions:
- State any assumptions that are being made about the project, such as network connectivity or availability of resources.

### Roles and Responsibilities:
- Define the roles of team members, including project manager, developers, testers, etc., and their responsibilities.
- All are developers. We will all assist in writing the code to make this game functional. Roles based on code are TBD.
- Change up Sprint lead each sprint.
- Test using ourselves, but also roomates, classmates, family members, friends.

### Communication Plan:
- Outline the communication channels and frequency for project updates, meetings, and decision-making.
- Everybody available on Teams for questions or help
- Meet 2 times a week if possible, on teams or in person.

### Additional Notes:
Include any other relevant information or considerations that are specific to your project.
